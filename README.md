# Benjamin Wilson's Portfolio ✨

## Description 🤙

I have created a portfolio to resemble the mockup image I have been given to the best of my abilities. I really enjoyed this project because I got to learn more about how to use grid in css!

## Repository 📁

What I have been doing to keep my repo clean and up to date

- I have constantly used git add, commit and push to ensure all changes have been updated to the github repo
- added extensive comments describing changes and what they could possibly mean for the client or developer
- Created a high quality read me file using different methods to convey and display info

## Code 🖥️

- I have ensure my code has remained clean and concise by implementing the following:
  - comments throughout my HTML and CSS to ensure I will understand what every line of code is used for or what element it affects
  - my indetntation allows me to find the start of every element and end
  - made sure all of my class name have followed the best naming conventions

> EXAMPLE: this code shows the my indentation, comments, and class nameing conventions used for this project:

```HTML
<!-- NAVIGATION BAR -->
    <nav class="navbar">
        <h1 class="nav__title">Benjamin Wilson</h1>
            <ul class="nav__links">
                <li><a href="#about"'>About Me</a></li>
                <li><a href="#work">Work</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact Me</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MarketingPlus/professional-portfolio/files/6112602/resume.docx" download="resume">Resume</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </nav>
```

> **(PLEASE NOTE THAT CODE WILL DIFFER IN ACTUAL HTML AS I HAVE FORMATED IT TO SUIT THIS DOCUMENT BETTER)**

> EXAMPLE: this code shows the equivent to the code above but for CSS:

```CSS
/* ================ NAVIGATION BAR ===================== */

/* navbar styling and colour */
.navbar {
  width: 100%;
  height: 10rem;
  background-color: var(--third-color);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

/* styling of my name */
.nav__title {

  margin-left: 100;
  color: var(--first-color);

  padding: 0.5rem 0.5rem 0.5rem 10rem;
